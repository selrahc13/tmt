Turbo Model Thingy code borrowed from flansmod

I didn't like being restricted to voxel-based models in Minecraft, so I borrowed the Turbo Model Thingy code from flansmod 4.9.0.
I opted to retain this code as a stand-alone module so I wouldn't contaminate my other projects with incompatibly licensed code.
